# Coplanar Nations: Israel & Palestine \[LIVE\]

>"*Coplanar Nations: Israel & Palestine*... is a hypnotic overlap of moving and flying geometric shapes laced with static, in the colors of those two countryâ€™s flags: blue, white, black, green, and red." -- Caroline Stover describing the fixed video work in the *Linear Abstraction for the 21st Century* exhibition at SCAD in 2015.

## About

Z-fighting is an artifact that arises in 3D rendering engines when the rendering order of two coplanar surfaces interfere with one another in the z-buffer. This interference creates artifacts that manifest as flickering, moire or tearing of the color/texture assigned to the surface shader.

Coplanar Nations is a body of work that employs the use of z-fighting to dramatize open armed conflicts between modern nations, states, peoples and governing bodies by mapping flags as textures onto coplanar surfaces in order to force-render a "compromised state", a resolution that is never fully resolved.

While the fixed video work has been screened in the US and abroad, this is the first time the work has been revisited and developed for live performance.
