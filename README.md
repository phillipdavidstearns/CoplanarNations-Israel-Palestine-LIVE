# Coplanar Nations \[LIVE\] (Series)

>"*Coplanar Nations*... is a hypnotic overlap of moving and flying geometric shapes laced with static, in the colors of those two countryâ€™s flags: blue, white, black, green, and red." -- Caroline Stover describing a fixed video version of the work addressing the conflict between Israel and Palestine in the *Linear Abstraction for the 21st Century* exhibition at SCAD in 2015.

## About

Z-fighting is an artifact that arises in 3D rendering engines when the rendering order of two coplanar surfaces interfere with one another in the z-buffer. This interference creates artifacts that manifest as flickering, moire or tearing of the color/texture assigned to the surface shader.

Coplanar Nations is a body of work that employs the use of z-fighting to dramatize open armed conflicts between modern nations, states, peoples and governing bodies by mapping flags as textures onto coplanar surfaces in order to force-render a "compromised state", a resolution that is never fully resolved.
